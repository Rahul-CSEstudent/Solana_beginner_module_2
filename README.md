# Solana Wallet Interaction Example

This is a simple example of a Solana wallet interaction using React and the Solana JavaScript SDK. It allows you to create a new Solana account, airdrop some SOL tokens, and transfer tokens to another account.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Rahul-CSEstudent/Solana_beginner_module_2.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd solana-wallet-interaction-example

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start

5. **Open your web browser and access http://localhost:3000 to view the application.**

## Usage

The application provides three buttons:

1. **Create**: Clicking this button generates a new Solana account and displays the public key and secret key.

2. **Airdrop**: After creating an account, click this button to airdrop 2 SOL tokens to the account using its public key.

3. **Transfer**: Click this button to transfer 1 SOL token from the created account to another predefined account. You need to create an account and airdrop tokens before you can transfer.
